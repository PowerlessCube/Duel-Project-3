#Project 3 Design Brief
- Using either React, Rails or both design a web application in four days.

##Sean McCoy's Duel App
- PowerlessCube has chosen to replicate Sean McCoy's Micro Board Game: Duel
```
"You've been walking for days in an endless plain. You vaguely remember a life before this, but now the golden fields are all that remain. In the distance, you spot your first traveler in this strange land, a stranger to you in all ways, save one -­ their sword.

Duel is a 2-­4 player card game, where the object of the game is to be the last man standing. You take turns playing numbered cards with special abilities from your hand to the play tower, and you lose if you can no longer play a card."
```
